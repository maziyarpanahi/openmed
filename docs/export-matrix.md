# Export Format Support Matrix

Which combinations of architecture family, export backend, and precision tier
does OpenMed actually support today? This page is the single answer, kept
honest against the code by a coherence test in
`tests/unit/test_export_matrix.py`.

Use it before you plan a conversion so you know up front whether your
architecture reaches your target runtime.

## Support levels

- ✅ **Supported** — a first-class path with a documented converter, unit
  tests, and (where relevant) a certification gate.
- ⚠️ **Partial / conditional** — path exists but has a documented restriction
  (for example a family allowlist, or "certified only when recall holds").
- ❌ **Not supported** — no converter, or explicitly rejected by the backend.

The matrix rows are the Hugging Face model-type strings and OpenMed family
names most contributors search for. The **MLX aliases** column lists the
token-classification aliases understood by
`openmed.mlx.models._SUPPORTED_TOKEN_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_TYPES` (or the MLX
custom-family set). The coherence test asserts every entry in that allowlist
appears here as a backtick-wrapped alias, so the matrix cannot drift silently
when a new family is added to the code.

## Known limitations

The cells above encode a handful of load-bearing constraints; the source of
truth is the backend code, but the essentials are:

- **GGUF is embedding-only.** `openmed.gguf.convert` deliberately rejects
  token-classification heads: llama.cpp can run the BERT-family encoder
  embedding path but does not expose the token classifier head required to
  produce OpenMed entity labels. Export the encoder backbone (for example a
  checkpoint whose `config.json` names `BertModel` rather than
  `BertForTokenClassification`) instead. See
  [GGUF Embedding Export](export-gguf.md).
- **CoreML is token-classification-only and enforces a family allowlist.**
  `openmed.coreml.convert.SUPPORTED_TOKEN_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_TYPES` accepts
  `bert`, `distilbert`, `electra`, `roberta`, `xlm-roberta`, and `deberta-v2`.
  Any other architecture fails before tracing with an error that lists the
  supported families. See [CoreML Packaging](coreml-export.md).
- **MLX enforces a family allowlist.** The MLX dispatcher resolves architectures
  through `_SUPPORTED_TOKEN_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_TYPES` (BERT-family,
  DeBERTa-v2, ModernBERT, and Longformer) plus the MLX-custom set
  (`gliner-uni-encoder-span`, `gliclass-uni-encoder`,
  `gliner-uni-encoder-token-relex`) and the privacy filter family.
  Architectures outside the allowlist raise a clear
  "unsupported family" error rather than falling through silently. See
  [MLX Backend](mlx-backend.md).
- **INT4 is certified only when recall holds.** `openmed.mlx.convert`
  will emit an INT4 artifact for any allowlisted family, but the artifact is
  marked `certified: false` in `recall_delta.json` when the measured per-label
  recall delta exceeds the INT4 limit. Release gates block over-budget INT4
  formats. See [MLX Quantized Export Certification](export-mlx-quant.md).
