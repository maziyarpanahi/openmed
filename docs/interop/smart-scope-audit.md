# SMART scope audit examples

OpenMed includes an offline SMART-on-FHIR scope comparison example for local
workflow planning. It compares the resource scopes a synthetic workflow says it
needs with the scopes declared for that workflow and reports missing or
excessive operations.

The example is deliberately local-only:

- it does not implement OAuth;
- it does not contact a FHIR server;
- it does not include endpoints, tokens, launch context values, or patient data;
- it uses synthetic resource names such as `SyntheticObservation`.

## Run the example

```bash
python examples/smart_scope_audit.py
```

The report is deterministic JSON with patient, user, and system context cases:

- a passing read-only patient workflow;
- a patient workflow missing a read scope;
- a user write workflow that over-claims search operations;
- a system read workflow with both missing and excessive scopes.

Each audit lists:

- `required_scopes`: normalized workflow needs;
- `declared_scopes`: normalized declared scopes;
- `missing_scopes`: required operations absent from the declaration;
- `excessive_scopes`: declared operations not needed by the workflow.

## Example shape

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "patient-read-missing",
  "status": "missing",
  "missing_scopes": [
    {
      "scope": "patient/SyntheticCondition.r",
      "context": "patient",
      "resource_type": "SyntheticCondition",
      "operations": [
        {
          "code": "r",
          "name": "read"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This helper is for deterministic local comparison only. It is not a production
permissions recommendation, an OAuth client, or a substitute for deployment
review.
