# Guarded clinical brief

Start with the [local summarizer](summarization.md), the
[clinical NLI gate](nli-verification.md), and the
[synthetic walkthrough and recording script](../demo/clinical-brief.md).

`openmed.clinical.build_clinical_brief()` composes the existing local clinical
guards into an immutable `ClinicalBrief`. It never treats a generated summary as
a diagnosis or as approval to act. Successful results still need human review.

## Input and review boundary

Pass a note or a `DeidentificationResult`, a local summarizer alias, a built-in
profile (default `bhc`), and an explicit `BriefContext`. A raw note is first
de-identified locally. Missing runtime/model assets fail closed. Without a
reviewed context the result is refused; the composer never manufactures review
history or assumes that de-identification is evidence approval.

`BriefContext` contains the existing `EvidencePacket`, its content digest, one
`BriefFact` per reference, a calibrated local three-class NLI callback with its
`NLIThresholds`, and a local privacy detector. The callback must identify the
same calibration as its thresholds. Training a default NLI artifact is optional
research, not an SDK release prerequisite; applications supply their calibrated
local verifier. This API does not invent one or fall back to a heuristic.

Before reviewing references, calculate `brief_policy_fingerprint(text, facts,
profile)`. This binds the review history to the exact de-identified text,
clinical axes and profile version. Create review transitions through the existing
review-state API only for work actually reviewed. Changed content or annotations
require a new review. The current evidence-packet contract is **synthetic-only**;
this implementation does not widen that boundary to real patient data.

The initial alignment policy is deliberately strict: each atomic generated claim
must exactly equal one unique reviewed source span. Paraphrases, ambiguous spans,
missing profile fields, demographic evidence, contradictions and NLI abstentions
are refused. This is not a general paraphrase-grounding system. Clinical axes come
from reviewed evidence, never inferred from a generated answer.

## Fixed execution and failure behavior

The stage order is not configurable: de-identification, sections, evidence,
summary-input contract, section plan, length budget, profile, generation, safety
envelope, demographic minimization, atomic claims, assertion/temporal/experiencer
pairs, calibrated NLI, citation consistency/boundaries/minimality, temporal order,
unsupported claims, coverage, citation support, empty-evidence guard, privacy,
review packet and provenance. Empty evidence is also rejected before generation.

Only reviewed spans are sent to the generator. Temporal uncertainty is retained
for human review; document order is not a claim that events occurred in that
order. Deterministic citation-span checks do not imply clinician adjudication.
The summary and the assembled protected response both pass the configured privacy
detector. Python outbound sockets are blocked; trusted callbacks are not isolated
plugins and must not invoke external processes/services themselves.

`refusal_reason` is a `BriefRefusal` enum. Refusals contain no partial summary.
Exceptions from backends are not copied into reports or chained into public
errors. The `stages` trace records entered stages; on refusal the last stage
identifies the failure boundary, not a claim that the stage passed.

The complete reason vocabulary is `invalid_input`, `review_required`,
`empty_evidence`, `invalid_evidence`, `unsupported_claim`, `nli_unavailable`,
`nli_rejected`, `privacy`, `length_budget_exceeded`, `model_unavailable`, and
`stage_failed`. Missing local runtime packages, unknown local aliases and
uncached artifacts use `model_unavailable`; unexpected execution failures remain
`stage_failed`. Remote providers remain prohibited. CLI, REST, MCP and clients
preserve these codes without exception messages, package details or private paths.
OpenMedKit reports `model_unavailable` for an unloaded or unavailable model.

### Evidence length budgets

The immutable `brief-profile-evidence-classes-v1` mapping assigns reviewed
profile fields to the existing `clinical_summary_v1` policy classes. Admission,
diagnoses, active problems and assessment share `active_problems`; background,
current situation, discharge condition, course and key findings share
`key_findings`. Discharge medications, procedures, pending items, follow-up/plan,
and safety concerns map to their matching classes. Unknown fields are refused.

`utf8-byte-upper-bound-v1` estimates demand as UTF-8 bytes plus one separator
between spans in each class. It is deliberately conservative, especially for
non-ASCII text; it is not a measured backend token count. Class caps are 192 for
active problems, 160 for findings, 128 each for medications and safety, and 96
each for procedures, pending items and follow-up, under the global 2,048 budget.
Deferred classes yield `length_budget_exceeded` at the length-budget stage before
generation. No policy cap is silently relaxed. The mapping, estimator identity
and counts-only budget are recorded in `metrics.length_budget`, bound into the
brief audit digest as budget provenance; source spans and tokenizer output are
never recorded there.

## Output handling

- `brief.summary` and `brief.to_response()` are protected application output.
  Do not log or persist them without an explicit application privacy boundary.
- `brief.to_dict()` omits all source and summary text and returns aggregate
  metrics, offsets, digests, fixed reasons, review packet and provenance.
- The deterministic `digest` binds the safe record, including the summary digest.
- The result never marks clinician review approved, even when all checks pass.

The synthetic unit fixtures use explicitly labelled test-only NLI scores and
privacy detectors. They verify orchestration and refusal behavior, not model
quality, clinical validation or a release benchmark.

## CLI and service interfaces

`openmed brief note.txt --model extractive --profile bhc --review-id <digest>
--context-factory my_application.review:provider --summary-output summary.txt
--review-output review.json` writes separate, newly created mode-0600 files. It
never overwrites existing destinations. Exit 1 means refusal; stdout contains
only counts, status and a digest. The installed factory is trusted local Python
configuration, not an upload or a server request parameter. It returns a callable
`(original_text, review_id) -> (DeidentificationResult, BriefContext)` backed by
the application's existing review and access-control store. Do not use this
mechanism to invent review histories or accept untrusted executable modules.

`POST /brief`, Python `OpenMedClient.brief(text, model="extractive",
review_id=...)`, TypeScript `client.brief({text, model: "extractive",
review_id})`, and the read-only MCP `openmed_brief` tool share the protected
response. Models are restricted to local aliases; remote URLs, approval records
and NLI scores are not accepted in requests. The opaque review reference is 64
lowercase hexadecimal characters. Configure REST with
`app.state.brief_context_provider` or MCP with the local runtime's
`brief_context_provider`; that provider must authorize access for the caller.
Missing review configuration returns a typed refusal, not an unguarded summary.
REST access logs add only bounded outcome vocabulary and counts to the normal
request duration. Never log the response: `summary` is protected content.
