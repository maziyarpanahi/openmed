History of Present Illness

Mr. John Doe is a 65-year-old male who presents with acute-onset chest pain that began approximately two hours prior to arrival while he was at rest, watching television. The pain is described as a heavy, pressure-like sensation in the mid-sternum radiating to the left shoulder and down the left arm to the elbow. He characterizes the pain as 8/10 at onset, currently 7/10, constant, and not clearly relieved by rest. He reports associated dyspnea and profuse diaphoresis. He denies syncope, presyncope, or palpitations but notes a sense of “impending doom.” He took his usual morning medications today, including aspirin 81 mg, but did not take any additional aspirin before arrival. No nitroglycerin was taken prior to ED arrival. There has been no recent trauma.

Triggers: none identified; pain began at rest.
Aggravating factors: minimal movement, anxiety.
Alleviating factors attempted: none; no antacids or analgesics taken pre-hospital.
Associated symptoms: shortness of breath, diaphoresis, mild nausea (no emesis).
Negatives: no pleuritic component, no hemoptysis, no calf pain/swelling, no recent immobilization, no known fever or cough, no recent upper respiratory symptoms.

Cardiac risk factors: age >55, male sex, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (2015), hyperlipidemia, former smoker (quit 2018; estimated 25 pack-years). Family history notable for father with myocardial infarction in his early 60s (details limited).

Medication adherence: Patient reports generally good adherence to metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and daily low-dose aspirin.

Erectile dysfunction medications: Denies recent use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.
Cocaine/stimulants: Denies.

⸻

ED Therapeutics – Initial
	•	Aspirin: chewed loading dose to total 325 mg administered in ED (patient already on 81 mg daily at home).
	•	Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg sublingual given once with BP monitoring; to repeat every 5 minutes up to 3 doses if pain persists and hemodynamics stable; avoid if evidence of RV infarct/hypotension.
	•	Oxygen: not initiated initially as SpO₂ 95% on room air; to start supplemental O₂ if saturation <90% or if respiratory status worsens.
	•	Analgesia/anxiolysis: IV fentanyl or morphine PRN per protocol if pain remains severe after nitrates and pending cardiology recommendations (weighing risks/benefits in ACS).
	•	Anticoagulation: Unfractionated heparin per weight-based STEMI protocol (bolus/infusion) ordered after initial EKG, coordination with cardiology.
	•	High-intensity statin: plan to increase atorvastatin to 80 mg nightly starting tonight, per ACS secondary prevention.
	•	P2Y12 inhibitor: ticagrelor 180 mg load considered; loading deferred to Cath Lab per interventional cardiology preference to align with procedural plan and bleeding risk assessment.
	•	Beta-blocker: metoprolol tartrate started cautiously if no signs of acute heart failure, hypotension, or bradycardia; timing coordinated with cardiology.

NPO status: ordered now in anticipation of urgent invasive management.
Consent: discussion initiated for emergent cardiac catheterization/PCI; risks/benefits reviewed; patient desires aggressive care and agrees to proceed pending cardiology evaluation.

⸻

Pertinent Results (as available during ED course)
	•	hs-Troponin (baseline): elevated above institutional upper reference (exact value pending at the time of first addendum).
	•	CBC/CMP/Coags: pending at time of note initiation; anticipate review prior to cath.
	•	Chest X-ray: pending; to assess for pulmonary edema, mediastinal contours, and alternate etiologies.

⸻

Differential Diagnosis
	1.	Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) – ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) suspected given inferior ST elevations with reciprocal changes and classic ischemic symptoms.
	2.	Aortic dissection – less likely; no tearing pain radiating to back; pulses symmetric; BP elevated but not extreme; CXR pending for mediastinal widening; still maintain vigilance in atypical presentations.
	3.	Pulmonary embolism – less likely given EKG and symptom constellation; denies risk factors such as recent immobilization or known malignancy; no pleuritic pain or hemoptysis.
	4.	Pericarditis/myopericarditis – less likely; ST changes not diffuse, presence of reciprocal depression; pain not pleuritic or positional.
	5.	Esophageal spasm/GERD – considered but less likely given diaphoresis, radiation, and EKG findings.
	6.	Musculoskeletal chest pain/costochondritis – unlikely given lack of reproducibility on palpation and associated systemic symptoms.

⸻

Assessment

1) Acute Coronary Syndrome – Inferior STEMI suspected.
	•	Symptom onset ~2 hours prior to arrival; EKG with inferior ST elevation and reciprocal changes; high pretest probability. Immediate cardiology activation warranted to achieve door-to-balloon target ≤90 minutes. Right-sided EKG to evaluate RV involvement prior to nitrates and to guide preload management. Serial enzymes ordered. Continuous rhythm monitoring for malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF, heart block—especially with inferior MI).

2) Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
	•	Hyperglycemia may worsen outcomes in ACS; initiate bedside glucose monitoring q4–6h with correctional insulin as needed.
	•	Metformin: continue while in ED; hold on day of contrast exposure and for 48 hours post-procedure or until renal function confirmed stable per standard practice if coronary angiography with contrast is performed. Baseline creatinine pending.

3) Hypertension.
	•	Presenting BP 150/95. Continue home lisinopril 10 mg daily once hemodynamically stable and not in acute renal impairment. Beta-blocker initiation will also assist with BP and heart rate control if no contraindications. Reassess regimen post-PCI/echo.

4) Hyperlipidemia.
	•	Escalate to high-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80 mg) as part of ACS secondary prevention bundle.

5) Tobacco use (remote).
	•	Former smoker; provide reinforcement of cessation and consider referral for ongoing support if needed.

⸻

Plan and Orders (Structured)

ACS/STEMI Management
	•	Activate cath lab immediately; notify interventional cardiology; aim for door-to-balloon ≤90 minutes from arrival.
	•	EKG: completed; Right-sided EKG pending to evaluate RV involvement.
	•	Antiplatelet therapy:
	•	Aspirin load to 325 mg already given; continue 81 mg daily thereafter.
	•	P2Y12 inhibitor loading per interventional cardiology (ticagrelor 180 mg or alternative) timed with procedure.
	•	Anticoagulation: heparin bolus/infusion per protocol; dose adjusted to weight and aPTT.
	•	Nitrates: SL nitro for ongoing pain if BP adequate and no RV infarct; consider IV nitroglycerin if persistent ischemia/hypertension and no contraindications.
	•	Analgesia: judicious opioid if severe pain persists after anti-ischemic therapy.
	•	Beta-blocker: consider metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO if no signs of acute decompensated heart failure, bradycardia, hypotension, or heart block.
	•	ACE inhibitor: continue lisinopril when stable; reassess post-MI and post-procedure renal function.
	•	Statin: escalate to atorvastatin 80 mg nightly.
	•	Echocardiogram (TTE): order post-PCI or as soon as feasible to assess wall motion abnormalities, LV ejection fraction, and potential RV involvement.
	•	Labs: trend serial troponins; check baseline lipid panel and HbA1c for risk stratification.
	•	Chest X-ray: review expeditiously for alternate causes/complications.
	•	Monitoring: telemetry, frequent vitals, continuous pulse oximetry.
	•	Fluids: cautious isotonic fluid bolus if RV infarct suspected and hypotension occurs; avoid unnecessary preload reduction.

Diabetes Management
	•	POC glucose now and q4–6h.
	•	Correctional insulin scale while NPO; transition to basal-bolus regimen if prolonged hospitalization anticipated.
	•	Metformin: continue today unless contrast administered; if angiography performed, hold metformin on the day of the procedure and for 48 hours thereafter until renal function remains stable.

Hypertension
	•	Reassess BP response after pain control and beta-blocker initiation.
	•	Continue lisinopril 10 mg daily when hemodynamically stable; evaluate need for titration at discharge planning.

Secondary Prevention & Education
	•	Cardiac diet, activity restrictions per cardiology post-PCI.
	•	Reinforce medication adherence; provide ACS education (symptom recognition, when to seek care).
	•	Smoking cessation reinforcement (although former smoker).
	•	Arrange for cardiac rehabilitation referral post-discharge.

⸻

Risk Stratification (for context)
	•	High-risk presentation given ischemic chest pain at rest, diaphoresis, and ST-segment elevation.
	•	Formal scores (e.g., GRACE/TIMI) not yet calculated but bedside assessment places patient in a category warranting urgent reperfusion.

⸻

Disposition
	•	Emergent cardiac catheterization with intent for primary PCI.
	•	If PCI delays anticipated, coordinate transfer to PCI-capable facility expeditiously.
	•	Post-procedure destination: Cardiac ICU/CCU for monitoring of arrhythmias, ischemia recurrence, and hemodynamics.

⸻

Medication Reconciliation (ED to Inpatient)
	•	Continue: Aspirin (transition to 81 mg daily after load), lisinopril 10 mg daily, atorvastatin increased to 80 mg nightly.
	•	Conditional: Metformin 1000 mg BID – continue if no contrast today; hold peri-contrast and resume once renal function confirmed stable.
	•	New (ED/ACS): Heparin infusion per protocol; P2Y12 inhibitor per cath lab; beta-blocker if no contraindications; PRN nitrates.
	•	Avoid/withhold: NSAIDs (non-aspirin) due to ACS.

⸻

Procedural Consent (summary of discussion)

Discussed the indication for urgent coronary angiography with possible percutaneous coronary intervention. Reviewed risks including bleeding, vascular injury, stroke, arrhythmia, myocardial perforation, need for emergent CABG, contrast-induced nephropathy, allergic reactions, and death. Alternatives (thrombolysis if PCI unavailable/contraindicated, medical management alone) discussed with associated risks of reduced efficacy. Patient demonstrates understanding and agrees to proceed. Spouse present and concurs.

⸻

ED Course & Timeline (sample)
	•	14:05 – Patient arrives; triage initiated; IV access obtained.
	•	14:12 – Initial EKG performed: inferior ST elevation; STEMI alert activated.
	•	14:15 – Aspirin load administered; labs sent; CXR ordered.
	•	14:18 – Heparin ordered per protocol; nitroglycerin administered with BP monitoring; pain decreases from 7/10 to 5/10.
	•	14:22 – Cardiology at bedside; right-sided EKG ordered.
	•	14:30 – Discussion of consent; patient agreeable; NPO enforced.
	•	14:40 – Transport arranged to Cath Lab; vitals stable; continuous monitoring maintained.

⸻

Safety/Handover Considerations
	•	Watch for conduction disturbances common in inferior MI (e.g., AV block). External pacing pads to be readily available.
	•	If RV infarct confirmed, avoid aggressive nitrates/diuretics; support preload and consider cautious fluids if hypotension ensues.
	•	Renal function to be verified before restarting metformin post-contrast.

⸻

Contingency Plans
	•	If hemodynamic instability occurs, follow ACLS protocols and notify cardiology emergently.
	•	If PCI is delayed beyond guideline targets and no contraindications, evaluate candidacy for fibrinolysis per cardiology.

⸻

Preliminary Impression
	1.	Acute Coronary Syndrome – STEMI (inferior, possible RV involvement).
	•	Serial EKGs and cardiac enzymes in progress.
	•	Urgent cardiology consultation completed; cardiac catheterization planned.
	2.	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
	•	Continue metformin unless contrast given; if angiography performed, hold metformin peri-contrast as above; initiate bedside glucose monitoring and correctional insulin.
	3.	Hypertension.
	•	Continue ACE inhibitor when stable; initiate/adjust beta-blocker as tolerated; reassess long-term regimen post-ACS.
	4.	Hyperlipidemia.
	•	Escalate to high-intensity statin (atorvastatin 80 mg nightly).

⸻

Orders (ED)
	•	Continuous telemetry; serial EKGs q15–30 min or with symptom change.
	•	Labs: hs-troponin ×3, CBC, CMP, Mg/Phos, PT/INR, aPTT, lipid panel, HbA1c, type & screen.
	•	Meds: Aspirin load (completed), heparin infusion per protocol, SL nitroglycerin PRN, consider beta-blocker, increase atorvastatin dose, P2Y12 load per cath lab.
	•	Imaging: Portable chest X-ray; later TTE.
	•	NPO effective immediately; IV fluids PRN.
	•	Cath Lab activation; arrange transport.

⸻

Teaching Points (for record)
	•	Oxygen is not indicated in normoxic ACS patients (SpO₂ ≥90%); titrate only if hypoxemic.
	•	Right-sided EKG is crucial in inferior STEMI to identify RV infarction where nitrates may precipitate hypotension.
	•	Secondary prevention bundle after STEMI typically includes dual antiplatelet therapy, high-intensity statin, ACE inhibitor/ARB, beta-blocker, and lifestyle modification/cardiac rehab.

⸻

Attending Addendum (to be completed)

I personally evaluated the patient, reviewed EKG and initial labs, coordinated with interventional cardiology, and agree with the plan for emergent angiography/PCI. Critical care activities included continuous hemodynamic assessment, interpretation of EKG, titration of anti-ischemic therapy, and preparation for invasive intervention.

Critical Care Time: ____ minutes (excluding procedures), for management of acute coronary syndrome with high risk of sudden deterioration.

Brief Summary (for discharge planning later)

Mr. Doe presented with 2-hour history of rest chest pain radiating to the left arm with diaphoresis and dyspnea. Initial EKG showed inferior ST elevation with reciprocal changes, consistent with STEMI. He received aspirin loading, anticoagulation, and anti-ischemic therapy; cath lab activated for primary PCI. Comorbidities include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia; plans include escalation to high-intensity statin, careful glucose control, and reassessment of antihypertensive regimen post-procedure. Metformin to be held peri-contrast per renal function status if angiography performed. Continuous monitoring and post-PCI care in CCU planned.
